Open source policies are policies that govern the <strong>use</strong> and <strong>creation</strong> of open source within a government organization. Open source resolutions are formal, public declarations of a commitment to open source that applies to all organizations within a government unit, such as a municipality, state, or county. Though open source is traditionally applied to software, it also applies to processes and other source materials produced at public, taxpayer expense.
